# Smart Shower Control App

## 🚿 Project Overview

The Smart Shower Control App is an innovative web-based application designed to revolutionize your shower experience. This project aims to create a user-friendly interface for controlling various aspects of a smart shower system, including temperature, water pressure, and shower head types, all from a convenient touchscreen display or through voice commands.

## 🌟 Features

- **Temperature Control**: Easily adjust water temperature with precision.
- **Water Pressure Adjustment**: Customize the water pressure to your liking.
- **Multiple Shower Head Modes**: Switch between different shower head types (e.g., rainfall, jet, handheld).
- **User Profiles**: Save and load personalized shower settings for multiple users.
- **Voice Control**: Hands-free operation through voice commands (coming soon).
- **Eco Mode**: Water and energy-saving options for environmentally conscious users.
- **Scheduling**: Set up automatic shower routines.
